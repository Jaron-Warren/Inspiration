# Goals

In this project students will demonstrate their ability to build a robust application requiring multiple asynchronous calls to retrieve several types of data. They will demonstrate a proficiency in utilizing multiple services and controllers to handle different aspects of data all rendered to the same document. In addition they will be responsible for implementing the observer pattern and utilizing subscribers to handle the asynchronistic aspects of this challenge.
